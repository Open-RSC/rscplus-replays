# RSC+ replays

RSC+ Replays are decryptable network data captured on official Jagex RSC servers between May 25th, 2018 and August 6th, 2018 stored to disk and released here for posterity.

These replays can be played back in the RSC+ client https://github.com/RSCPlus/rscplus or they can be scraped for data automatically using a tool like https://github.com/RSCPlus/rscminus.

This github repo is a release of all RSC+ recordings that remain in their original format and are known to freely exist. Additional replays which have had chat removed for privacy are available at https://github.com/RSCPlus/rscplus-supplemental-replays.
